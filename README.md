# ChargeGraphs
This eventual goal of this program is to be able to simulate (approximately) arbitrary point charges moving around on a plane, and graph the potential, either as color in 2D, or as a 3D surface where height represents the potential.

### Progress
Currently, the program can show a few different systems of particles with some variables controlled by mouse position.  It shows a 3D potential map where height is also shown by color, making small potential differences more obvious.
