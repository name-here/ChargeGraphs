# ChargeGraphs
This eventual goal of this program is to be able to simulate (approximately) arbitrary point charges moving around on a plane, and graph the potential, either as color in 2D, or as a 3D surface where height represents the potential.

### Progress
Currently, the program can show a system of particles that can be manipulated on a separate editing screen.  It can show a 3D potential map where height is also shown by color, making small potential differences more obvious.
